# ü•ó Python Nutrition Tracker

A secure, deployable web application built with Streamlit and Supabase to track daily nutritional intake, including calories and macronutrients. This app features a public, view-only mode for guests and a secure, admin-only mode for data entry and management.

---

## Core Features

* **Daily Food Logging:** Log meals with descriptions, calories, protein, carbs, and fats.
* **Customizable Daily Goals:** Set default goals and override them for specific days (e.g., workout vs. rest days).
* **Historical Goal Tracking:** Each meal entry stores the goal that was active at the time, ensuring analytics are always accurate.
* **Interactive Meal Management:** A single, intuitive data editor allows the admin to add, update, and delete entries on both desktop and mobile.
* **Rich Analytics Dashboard:** Visualize progress with interactive time-series charts comparing daily intake vs. goals for calories, protein, carbs, and fats.
* **Secure Admin/Guest Access:**
    * **Guest Mode:** Publicly accessible, view-only dashboard. Guests cannot modify any data.
    * **Admin Mode:** Requires secure login. The admin has full control to add, edit, and delete all data.
* **API Overload Protection:** Implements server-side caching to protect against denial-of-service attacks and conserve free-tier API limits.

## Tech Stack

This project uses a modern, efficient stack chosen for rapid development, ease of use, and a generous free tier for hosting.

* **Python:** The core programming language for the entire application.
* **Streamlit:** A Python framework used to build the entire interactive user interface with minimal code. It's responsible for rendering all pages, widgets, and charts.
* **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and aggregation, forming the backbone of the analytics dashboard.
* **Plotly Express:** Powers the interactive charts on the Analytics Dashboard.
* **Supabase:** A cloud-based PostgreSQL database used as the persistent data store. It handles the database, user authentication, and row-level security.

## Local Setup and Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+ installed on your system.
* A free [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account.
* A free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

### 2. Supabase Project Setup

1.  **Create a New Project:** In your Supabase dashboard, create a new project.

2.  **Create the `entries` Table:**
    * Go to the **Table Editor** and click **"Create a new table"**.
    * Name the table `entries`.
    * **Important:** Uncheck "Enable Row Level Security (RLS)" for now. We will enable it later.
    * Add the following columns with the specified types:
        * `id` (int8) *settings: 'is unique', 'is identity'*
        * `entry_date` (date) *settings: uncheck all, no default value*
        * `description` (text) *settings: uncheck all, no default value*
        * `calories` (int4) *settings: uncheck all, no default value*
        * `protein` (int4) *settings: uncheck all, no default value*
        * `carbs` (int4) *settings: uncheck all, no default value*
        * `fats` (int4) *settings: uncheck all, no default value*
        * `goal_calories` (int4) *settings: uncheck all, no default value*
        * `goal_protein` (int4) *settings: uncheck all, no default value*
        * `goal_carbs` (int4) *settings: uncheck all, no default value*
        * `goal_fats` (int4) *settings: uncheck all, no default value*
        * `user_id` (uuid) *settings: uncheck all, no default value*

3.  **Create the `profiles` Table:**
    * Click **"Create a new table"** again.
    * Name the table `profiles`. Uncheck "Enable Row Level Security (RLS)" for now.
    * Add the following columns:
        * `id` (uuid) *settings: uncheck all, no default value*
        * `email` (text) *settings: 'is nullable', uncheck all else, no default value*
        * `is_approved` (bool) *settings: uncheck all, default: 'false'*
        * `api_call_count` (int4) *settings: uncheck all, default: '0'*
        * `last_api_call_date` (date) *settings: 'is nullable', uncheck all else, no default value*
    * **Add a Foreign Key:** Click the "link" icon next to the `id` column and add a foreign key relation to `id` -> `auth.users`.

4.  **Create the Database Trigger to automatically create a profile for each new user:**
    * Navigate to the **SQL Editor**.
    * Click **"New query"** and paste the entire script below:
    ```
    -- 1. Create a function that inserts a new row into public.profiles
    create or replace function public.handle_new_user()
    returns trigger
    language plpgsql
    security definer set search_path = public
    as $$
    begin
      insert into public.profiles (id, email)
      values (new.id, new.email);
      return new;
    end;
    $$;

    -- 2. Create the trigger that calls the function after a new user is created
    create trigger on_new_user_create_profile
      after insert on auth.users
      for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();
    ```
    * Click **"Run"**.

5.  **Set Your Site URL:**
    * Go to **Authentication -> URL Configuration** and set the **Site URL** to your app's deployment URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`)

6.  **Create Your Admin User:**
    * Go to **Authentication -> Users** and click **"Add User"**.
    * Enter the email and password you want to use for your admin account.
    * **Important:** After the user is created, copy their **User UUID**. You will need this for the security policies.

7.  **Enable Row Level Security (RLS):**

    **Enable RLS:**
    * Go to **Authentication -> Policies** and enable RLS for both the `entries` and `profiles` tables.
    * Create Policies for `entries`:
        * **Policy 1 (Read):** Name: `Allow individual read access`, Operation: `SELECT`, USING expression: `auth.uid() = user_id`
        * **Policy 2 (Write):** Name: `Allow individual write access`, Operation: `ALL`, USING expression: `auth.uid() = user_id`, WITH CHECK expression: `auth.uid() = user_id`
        
    * Create Policies for `profiles`:
        * **Policy 1 (Read Self):** Name: `Allow users to read own profile`, Operation: `SELECT`, USING expression: `auth.uid() = id`
        * **Policy 2 (Admin Read All):** Name: `Allow master admin to read all profiles`, Operation: `SELECT`, USING expression: `auth.uid() = 'PASTE_YOUR_MASTER_USER_UUID_HERE'`
        * **Policy 3 (Admin Update):** Name: `Allow master admin to update profiles`, Operation: `UPDATE`, USING expression: `auth.uid() = 'PASTE_YOUR_MASTER_USER_UUID_HERE'`

8.  **Manually Approve Your Admin Account:**
    * Go to the **Table Editor** -> `profiles` table.
    * Find your master admin's row and change `is_approved` from `false` to `true`.



### 3. Local Code Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-repo-folder>
    ```
2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Create the Secrets File:**
    * Create a folder named `.streamlit` in your project's root directory.
    * Inside that folder, create a file named `secrets.toml`.
    * Find the required credentials:
    1. URL: In your Supabase dashboard, find the URL in Project Settings -> Data API -> Project URL 
    2. KEY: Find the API Key in Project Settings -> API Keys -> Legacy API Keys (use the key labeled anon and public)
    * Add your Supabase credentials to this file:
        ```toml
        SUPABASE_URL = "https://<your-project-id>.supabase.co"
        SUPABASE_KEY = "your-anon-public-key"
        ```
5.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
